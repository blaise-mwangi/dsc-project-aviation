## Overview
We will use data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for purchasing and operating airplanes.
## Business Problem
A company is interested expanding into new industries to diversify its portfolio.Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft.We are to determine which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor.
## Data
The dataset used is from the National Transportation Safety Board which includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters.
### Data Understandind/EDA
Used Summary Statistics such as df.info(),df.describe(),df.columns to understand the data
### Data Cleaning/Preparation 
We checked for missing values, handle missing values, check for duplicates, and data type conversion
Filtered Relegant Columns
### Data Visualization
We used Data Visulazation to help us answer the objectives.The charts are categorised into:
- Try to give a brief understanding of the potential risks of aircraft.
  - Does weather conditions cause any risk to aircraft?
  - Does the engine type cause any risk to aircraft?
  - Does the number of engine cause any impact to the aircraft?
  - Does the model contribute to any risk?
  - Does the aircraft category affect risk?
  - Identify which phases of flight contribute most to accidents
- Examine accident occurrences over time
- Determining whether it is better purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial or private enterprise
- Determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company when starting this new business endeavor.
### Conclusion
- The mojor risk factors are:  Number of engines ,Engine type,Model, Aircraft Category, Make ,Model, Broad phaseof flight
- As years go by there is a drop in accident numbers
- Personal flights have the highest number of accidents withe the airplane being the biggest contributor.      
- Airplanes are less costly in purchase and maintance compared to the other eg helicoptersWe can conclude that from the model and make of aircraft with most accidents,most of them are old hence there performance reduces with time.
### Recommendation
- Use modern model aircrafts since they are not worn out hence reducing risk due to model.There will also be chances that theyre are advernsment in these aerolanes.
- Invest in business purpose rather than private since they have lesser risk.
- Use aircrafts with turbo engine type where the purpose is aerial application instead of Reciprocating Engines
- Incase you want to venture into personal flights use helicopters instead of airplanes. They can be expensive to purchase and maintain but its less risky
